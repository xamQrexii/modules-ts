- what is module?
    - In TypeScript, a module is like a container for code. It helps keep your code organized by letting you split it into separate files. 
      You can export things from one module (like functions or variables) and import them into another module to use them. 
      This makes it easier to manage large projects and reuse code in different parts of your application.

    - external

    - create students data
    - get all students list

- import and export
    - named export
    - default export
    - named import 
    - default import
    - import as alias
    - import *

- when to use name and default export
    - use named exports when you need to export multiple items from a module
    - use a default export when a module has a single primary item to export
    - you can combine both if needed, but usually, it's better to keep it simple and clear
